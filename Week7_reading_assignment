What stood out to me most in this chapter of the book was a line on page 146: "As such, the event is no longer the same event because it is constantly re-constituted by other events, representations, and disseminations that recursively coalesce". This then leads to the public sphere being built by different individuals/communities in these feedback loops that ultimately have so many stories and places connected through the common space (i.e. social media). This thought has been one I have thought o fbefore when reflecting on the power of social media, however its application on a global scale is new to me. Further, it brings social media being seen as a simple post from an old friend and moves into the power it holds for the public domain as a whole. This is a good and bad thing, as described as such in the chapter, and there are so many more complexities than I have initially thought of. The bad coming from things like misinformation, which I argue are insanely detrimental to societies and the world as a whole for spreading information, as repittion of falsehoods are often taken as true which in turn completely alters how societies may view or **think** they know another culture. The negatives aside, however, learning of HyperCities Now for the events in Egypt and seeing how useful it was as a source for individuals to be more vulnerable with their experiences was so meaningful to read about. The details of the behind the scenes is equally as important: making parameters for distance in Egypt and specific hashatags used when publid data was so limited in the nation without internet. It is how social media should be used: to help others and created by other humans who make cognitive decisions off how/what will be shared. I further chose to read about Japan and the real-time disaster relief from 5,000+ miles away with GIS CrisisCommons. It blew my mind to see how many reports of incidents were reported via Twitter, 700 million tweers collected is insane. The sentiment analysis on said tweets around the time of Japan's crises were equally as enlightening, solidifying and bringing to light that there are real emotions behind the words printed on someone's Twitter feed, even if many people may feel like a tweet or RT is just that, rather than the distant person on the other end. By the time stamps and locations of tweets, and the content in which they held, it is moving to see how Twitter data can be used in such a way that explains a story, that relays events moment by moment with emption attached. It gives a global news story a heartbeat, and that is so important for people to realize in the public sphere. Data analysis, and all its components, make that possible.
