# Hi! My name is Paige and I have a variety of interests ranging from neuroscience and mental health to marketing and brand interaction with consumers through data mining. With this class, I am to become more skilled with Python and ability to interpret data sets into something more meaningful. Some project ideas would be: emercency related dealths in relation to location of hospitals in Los Angeles (or other major cities) or a product's success with consumers based on area within the US, or globally. I am really looking forward to this course!
