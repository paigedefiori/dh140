# Hi! My name is Paige and I have a variety of interests ranging from neuroscience and mental health to marketing and brand interaction with consumers, through data mining. With this class, I am to become more skilled with Python and ability to interpret data sets into something more meaningful. Some project ideas I have include: emercency related deaths in relation to location of hospitals in Los Angeles (or other major cities) or a crime activity in Los Angeles in relation to area wihtin the county. Though these are some of my ideas, I am interested tomy classmates' ideas as well and I am really looking forward to this course!
