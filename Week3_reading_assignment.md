Honestly, I never really thought about spatial data / mapping before. Maps, and their marked locations, were always just available at my finger tips and I never though anything more of it. However, once Rachel opened the video with how mapping is open data and volunteer based is mind blowing, espcially when she delved into its uses for the current COVID-19 pandemic and helping with comminity preparedness. This made me realize that maps and their geomarkers dont jiusr show up out of no where, people invest time and effort into making sure maps have accurate locations and their respecitve details. This really intrigued me. Once she specified the humanitarian efforts, mainly with COVID-19, as this is what my final project pertains to, I was impressed to see how thorough and quickly people are to update the open data / maps to add the ffrequently changing details of locations (i.e. stores, resturants, etc.) during the pandemic. It is beyond making a map to "make a map" for travel, but rather they serve purposes that are useful in all aspects of life; whether that be trivial like a map on Uber to mak esure you're getting home safely, to something more meaningful like establishing key COVID-19 testing locations in cities that need more support during these unprecedented times. I think utilizing open data in these useful ways is a beautiful thing and insanely impressive to be done on a volunteer basis by all walks of life.
