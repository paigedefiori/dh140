In an article published on [the Auto Insurance Center](https://www.autoinsurancecenter.com/emergency-response-times.htm), they analyzed the emergency response times across the United States, by state. They used data from 1994-2013, based on the Fatality Analysis Reeporting System [(FARS)](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars), which includes location, dates and times of fatal car accidents. The fatal car accidents were then used in conjunction with emergency reponse times to compare and uncover the time it took for the emergency vehicles to arrive to the scene. The article has a map that showcases the average response times by state and many charts that specify response times during certain: months, times of day and holidays. Interestingly, the average response time in the U.S. is 15 minutes and 19.2 seconds, the longest time being Wyoming at 35 minutes and Illinois at 6 minutes. Their data revealed the asssumption that states with low density of population had slower response times than that of those with high population density. The population density is also influenced by state size. The data further showed that the summer months had an increase in fatal crashes and is mirrored in an increase of average emergency reponse time. Conclusively they found that states' emergency response times vary based on location, time off year and day. 
I selected this article because the topic the data is reflecting is so important to analyze, being that emergency response times are often the means of life or death ffor those involved in a fatal car accident. With a topic so serious, the preconceived notions surrounding emergency reponse times in certain cities (i.e. Los Angeles EMS being slow due to traffic) can then be confirmed or not. I find this extermely interesting, especially being their data analysis revealed Califfornia having some of the fastest average times of arrival. If I were to build off of this data analysis, I would focus on major cities, like Los Angeles and New York City, for more specific results. Further, in my own data science goals I would aim to be more specific so that my anaylsis could be viewed as more accurate or meaningful given a circumstance so important, like fatal car incidents or city crime rates. I enjoyed this article because there was no fluff, it cut straight to revealing data and placing said data into maps/charts that were easy to digest. Though not exactly the type of work I would aim to produce, the use of meaningful data in a pretty display is my goal of the application of data science.
