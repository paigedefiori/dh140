###### Week 1 Reading Assignment <h6>
In an article published on [the Auto Insurance Center](https://www.autoinsurancecenter.com/emergency-response-times.htm), they analyzed the emergency response times across the United States, by state. They used data from 1994-2013, based on the Fatality Analysis Reeporting System [(FARS)](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars), which includes location, dates and times of fatal car accidents. The fatal car accidents were then used in conjunction with emergency reponse times to compare and uncover the time it took for the emergency vehicles to arrive to the scene. The article has a map that showcases the average response times by state and many charts that specify response times during certain: months, times of day and holidays. Interestingly, the average response time in the U.S. is **15 minutes and 19.2 seconds**, the longest time in Wyoming at 35 minutes and the shortest in Illinois at 6 minutes. The data revealed the asssumption that states with low density of population had slower response times than that of those with high population density. The population density is also influenced by state size. The data further showed that the summer months had an increase in fatal crashes and is mirrored in an increase of average emergency reponse time. Conclusively, they found that states' emergency response times vary based on location, time off year and day.

Though the data is slightly out of date, I selected this article because the _topic_ the data is reflecting is so important, being that emergency response times are often the means of life-and-death for those involved in fatal car accidents. With a topic so serious, the preconceived notions surrounding emergency reponse times in certain locations can then be confirmed or not. I find this extremely interesting, especially being their data analysis revealed California having some of the fastest average times of arrival, when cities like Los Angeles have an assumption for slow response times due to crazy traffic. If I were to build off of this article's data analysis, I would focus more closely on major cities, like Los Angeles or New York City, for more specific results. Similarly, in my own data science projects, I would aim to be that specific so that my anaylsis could be viewed as more accurate or meaningful. This is especailly the case since the data I want to research surrounds circumstances that are momentous, like fatal car incidents or city crime rates. I enjoyed this article because there was no fluff, it cut straight to revealing data and placing said data into maps/charts that were easy to digest. Though not *exactly* the type of work I would aim to produce, the use of meaningful data in aesthetic displays is a goal I have for data science research and its practical applications.
