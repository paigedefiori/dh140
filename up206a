###### About Me <h6> 

Hi! My name is Paige and I have a variety of interests ranging from neuroscience and mental health to marketing and brand interaction with consumers, through data mining. With this class, I am to become more skilled with Python and ability to interpret data sets into something more meaningful. Some project ideas I have include: happiness related to COVID in relation to location globally (or other major cities) or crime activity in Los Angeles in relation to COVID within the county. Though these are some of my ideas, I am interested tomy classmates' ideas as well and I am really looking forward to this course!
